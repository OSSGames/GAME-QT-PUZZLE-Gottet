Gottet is a clone of Tetris I wrote for my wife. Pieces fall from the top
of the play area and you can move them horizontally as well as rotate them
before they reach the bottom of the play area. The goal is to create full
lines of pieces, which are then removed. The game is over when the stack
of pieces reaches the top of the play area.
